# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mathematical model of a rabbit sinoatrial node cell.**   
Demir SS, Clark JW, Murphey CR, Giles WR. _Am J Physiol_ 1994 Mar;266(3 Pt
1):C832-52 [8166247](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8166247) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model for the electrophysiological responses of a rabbit
sinoatrial node cell that is based on whole cell recordings from enzymatically
isolated single pacemaker cells at 37 degrees C has been developed. The ion
channels, Na(+)-K+ and Ca2+ pumps, and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger in the surface
membrane (sarcolemma) are described using equations for these known currents
in mammalian pacemaker cells. The extracellular environment is treated as a
diffusion-limited space, and the myoplasm contains Ca(2+)-binding proteins
(calmodulin and troponin). Original features of this model include 1) new
equations for the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, 2) assessment of
the role of the transient-type Ca2+ current during pacemaker depolarization,
3) inclusion of an Na+ current based on recent experimental data, and 4)
demonstration of the possible influence of pump and exchanger currents and
background currents on the pacemaker rate. This model provides acceptable fits
to voltage-clamp and action potential data and can be used to seek
biophysically based explanations of the electrophysiological activity in the
rabbit sinoatrial node cell.
